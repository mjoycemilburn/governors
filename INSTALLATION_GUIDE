## Step 1

If you're reading this you won't need me to tell you about the procedure for obtaining an ISP account and registering a URL. So it's assumed that your starting point is the download of the zip file for the latest release of "governors" and the upload into an appropriate directory. 

It's suggested that if you have more than one system on your URL that you give each system its own directory. In this case the entire unzipped file hierarchy might be uploaded into a /governors directory, for example. Alternatively, just upload into public_html - the software uses relative addressing so won't mind.

## Step 2

Your next job will be to create a database for the system. The name of this can be whatever you choose but you need to use the sql script in mysql_tables to initialise it.

You now need to create connect and disconnect php scripts for the database and place them in your server's root directory. The system expects these to be called connect_governors_db.php and disconnect_governors_db.php. Templates for these files can be found in the connect_governors_db_prototype.php and disconnect_governors_db_prototype.php files included in the package. Obviously you need to set the 'hostname','root','password' and 'database_name' fields in the templates with the corresponding settings for the database you've just created.

## Step 3

The system doesn't provide a mechanism for creating entries in either the Schools or the Users table. This is because arrangements for ongoing administration of these records will depend upon your circumstances. One possibility is that these are records are created manually by a central administrator in response to school requests for registration. Alternatively it would be possible to create an automated arrangement whereby schools registered themselves. Just to get things going, the database script you applied in step 2 should have uloaded governor data for adummy "Newbiggin" school with access credentials test/tst$
