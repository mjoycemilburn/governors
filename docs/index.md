## User Guide to the *governors* System

If the system has been installed in url "mygovernors.com", the maintenance program is launched by referencing url mygovernors.com/manager.html

The system will respond by requesting user-id and password credentials. These  will have been supplied when you register for use of the system and associate your user_id (typically a clerk email address) with the school's entries in the system's data-stores.

The system targets three areas of data : governor-details, meeting-details/governor-attendances and school documents. The system's focus is switched by clicking one of the three buttons displayeed in the top panel of the screen. By default, the system is initially focussed on Governor details and displays, in the lower panels, a summary of the members of the governog body together with associated data-management buttons.

## Governor Details

On successful login, the system will display an initial screen similar to that shown below for demo school "Newbiggin".

Clicking the "Add new governor" button reveals a governor insert form:

Back on the Governor summary panel, the update and delete buttons provide tools to manage reords for individual governors.

Every Governing Body must have a clerk so a dummy record is created automatically when a new school is registered and is immediately available for amendment.

At the bottom of the screen, two buttons are available to display links to pages tailored expressly for display on the schools website. Because display of Governor business interests can be sensitive and not every school will wish to offer these details, these are offered through a separate button from the main button, which displays details of governor names, thypes (eg parent-governor), role (eg Chair) and contact details. When clicked, these buttons launch the pages as new tabs in the web browser. These tabs reveal the url for the pages and it is expected that these will be used to create links in the school's website. See below for an example of the Governor summary page
