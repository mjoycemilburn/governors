The **governors** system provides a simple web-based mechanism to enable the Clerk for the Governing Body (GB) of a UK school to maintain Governor records and to communicate these both to the public and to a Local Education Authority (LEA). It also provides a simple document management mechanism to systematise the storage and distribution of School documents such as policy statements.

The motivation behind development of the system stems from the fact that:

1. The GB of a maintained school is legally required to publish certain statutory information about both its composition and its proceedings on the school's website (see  https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-maintained-schools-must-publish-online). 

2. The GB, likewise is responsible for approving operational material such as "Health and Safety" policies etc and ensuring that these too are published.

3. Finally, the GB for a maintained school needs to share its records with its LEA officers to ensure they are kept up with changes in the GB's composition and contact addresses etc. All of these activities benefit from the use of a shared, web-based information system.

The governors system is written in Javascript and PHP and uses a MySQL database to maintain its records. The idea is that a sponsoring LEA, or a group of school who appreciate the advantages of using a shared system, might acquire some web-server resource and install the governors software thereon. A description of the installation procedure is provided in the INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md document above.
